Imagine if Racket allowed this:

```
(dynamic-rerequire "/path/to/script.js")
(dynamic-require "/path/to/script.js" 'minified)
```

That's what `unlike-assets` does.

## Okay, I'm Listening.
`unlike-assets` is a bit like Webpack, except leaner and powered by
Racket. It ships with a configurable module resolver for non-Racket
ecosystems. Under this light, an SVG document, a CSS stylesheet, an
SPIR-V shader, or a tarball are importable objects that are never out
of date.

Let's say you reference a stylesheet using one of the _procure_
functions provided by this project:

```
`(link ((rel "stylesheet") (href ,(Ps& "styles.css"))))
```

Given your configuration, this will produce a production-ready
variant of the element.

```
'(link ((rel "stylesheet") (href "../8a2b14.css")))
```

In this context, `../8a2b14.css` is a minified sheet that _really is_
one directory up from where this document will be in production. That
level of correctness is derived from your configuration.

Assume you edit the stylesheet and move it somewhere else while you work.
All you have to do is evaluate the dependent expression again.

```
`(link ((rel "stylesheet") (href ,(Ps& "styles.css"))))
; And now it's '(link ((rel "stylesheet") (href "styles/df9012.css")))
```

## What's Here?
This repository tracks a contained ecosystem of packages. It all starts in
`unlike-assets-resolver`, which provides a configurable module resolver
that asynchronously maps string URLs to up-to-date hashes.

The other packages play different roles. Most of them define a kind of
asset that the resolver can use. Others offer recipes that ease use
of lower-level packages. If you don't want to think about it too much,
you'll just want the `unlike-assets` package, which bundles useable
defaults with a `#lang`.

Once the defaults no longer suffice, you will need to install
the packages relevant to you.

## WTF is with this filesystem?
**Short answer**: Racket made me do it. Read the docs.

**Long answer:** Racket's module resolver thinks of _packages_ and
_collections_ as two different things. If you come from JavaScript or
Python, you can install a package and type that package's name with an
`import` or `require`. _That's not how it works here._

In Racket, a collection is a logical grouping of modules. Packages
**_contribute_** to collections. So when you install
`unlike-assets-css`, it will toss a `css` module into the
`unlike-assets` collection so you can write `(require
unlike-assets/css)`.

Racket (more specifically `raco`) has file conventions for this
workflow. This is why you see a bunch of nested directories with the
same names, and files with different names for the same role.


## Optional Reading: Project Vision
My hope is to lower the barrier between Racket programmers and
incompatible technologies. By making other ecosystems act as if they
were part of Racket's module system, you can unlock massive creative
control over programming projects. I believe this is the shortest
path between Racket's ability to swap notations and the features
that cost too much to implement in pure Racket.


## Contributing
The repo is just a bucket for packages. Just toss one in package to
integrate an `unlike-assets` build system with something. Please
include tests, docs, and logging.
